# EmoTag üëç üòÑ 
An emoji-centric NLP resources based on Twitter Data

## About

EmoTag is a collection of resources for analyzing the emotion and sentiment of Emojis as well as Tweets written in English. The name EmoTag indicates its usefulness in exploiting emojis for emotional tagging.  

## EmoTag Resources
* **Baseline Emoji Emotion Scores**: 1200 Emoji-Emotion pairs annotated by humans. It contains emotion scores ranging from 0 to 1 for 150 most popular Twitter emojis for 8 emotion classes (i.e. anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust). [[Download Scores](data/EmoTag1200-scores.csv)] [[Download Details](data/EmoTag1200-scores-details.csv)]  

* **Interpretable Word Vectors**: A 620-dimensional vector representation of words and emojis trained on ~20.8 million emoji-centric Twitter data. [[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_mAUwwsV_DgfPQOtlH5S2O8Evq7QJaNx?usp=sharing)]

* **Raw Tweets**: This contains Tweet IDs of ~20.8 million tweets used in our experiments. Please contact us if you need additional samples. [[Download All Tweet IDs](data/emotag-tweet-id.zip)] 

* **Word-Emoji Co-occurrence Frequencies**: This lexicon provides word-emoji co-occurrence frequencies observed in our dataset. [[Download](data/word-emoji-cooccur.zip)] 

* **Emoji-Emoji Co-occurrence Frequencies**: This is the subset of the previous lexicon (i.e. Word-Emoji co-occurrences) which contains only emoji-emoji co-occurrence counts observed in our dataset. This would be useful if someone quickly wants to find co-occurring emojis. [[Download](/data/emotag-emoji-emoji-cooccur.zip)]
